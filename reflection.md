My p5.js  artwork and the version generated by ChatGPT both represent a simple smiley face, but they differ in the choices behind how each one was constructed. In my sketch, I focused on creating a brighter, more playful expression by adjusting the proportions, using larger eyes, and giving the smile a thicker, more exaggerated curve. ChatGPT’s version feels more neutral and balanced, with smaller features and a cleaner, more symmetrical layout. 
These differences show how human decisions like wanting something to look cuter, funnier, or more expressive shape the final result in ways that an AI doesn’t naturally prioritize.
Comparing the two also highlights the contrast between human‑coded visuals and AI‑generated output. My sketch reflects personal intention and experimentation, while the AI’s version feels more standardized and literal. Even though we were both working from the same idea, our interpretations diverged: mine leans more playful and stylized, while the AI’s is more minimal and straightforward. This assignment made it clear that human creativity brings emotional choices and personality into the work, whereas AI tends to produce a technically correct but less expressive interpretation.
