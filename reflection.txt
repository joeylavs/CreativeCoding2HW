 used ChatGPT to generate my AI image, mostly because it was the easiest tool for me to access and I was already using it for the rest of the assignment.
My prompt was pretty straightforward, but the image I got wasn’t really what I expected—it went in its own weird direction, which was kind of funny but also interesting to work with.
Even though it wasn’t exactly what I pictured, it still added a unique element to the project and helped me think about how AI interprets ideas differently than I do.
